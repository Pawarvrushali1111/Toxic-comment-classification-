# Toxic-comment-classification-
We have data of large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. Using that data we will build the classification model.

## Classification model:
For classification purpose **BERT** is used.
This project is run using Google colab.
Because of lack of memory I was unable to train the whole dataset.
But at last we can see the results are impressive.We got 
training loss ==> 0.548200	
Validation loss ==> 0.571721	
Accuracy ==> 0.910104
